A super cool nixie clock made with a custom PCB powered by a raspberry pi pico W
## Why
I recently discovered nixie tubes and was like "I should totally make something with that". I wanted to make something a bit more complicated for my first go, but this clock sets me up pretty well do to some cooler stuff (and will make for a pretty awesome present).
